    Espresso supports:

    <ul>
      <li>Route handlers, like \`app.get()\` and \`app.post()\`</li>
      <li>Express-compatible middleware, like \`app.use(require('cors')())\`</li>
      <li>Express 4.0 style subrouters</li>
    </ul>

    As a bonus, Espresso also supports async functions, unlike Express.
