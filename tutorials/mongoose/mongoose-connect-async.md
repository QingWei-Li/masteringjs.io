Mongoose has two ways of connecting to a MongoDB database, [connect()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html) and [createConnection()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#multiple_connections). You can use these within an async function as follows:

```javascript
[require:Mongoose.*mongoose-connect-async.*gh-40a]
```

and for createConnection()

```javascript
[require:Mongoose.*mongoose-connect-async.*gh-40b]
```
