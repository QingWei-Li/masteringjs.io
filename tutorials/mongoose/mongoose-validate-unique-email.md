With Mongoose, you can prevent duplicates in your databases using [Validation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html). Validation is defined in the SchemaType and is a middleware. You can also create your own validation in the schema or you can use Mongooses's built in validation. To prevent duplicates, we recommend using the `unique` property as it tells Mongoose each document should have a unique value for a given path, and you can read about that [here](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/mongoose/unique). It is important to note that the `unique` option is not a validator, and you can read more about that [here](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html#the-unique-option-is-not-a-validator). It is a shorthand for creating a MongoDB unique index on, in this case, `email`. If you wait for the index to be built, you can use either Mongoose's `Model.on('index')` event or you can you Mongoose's promised based alternative, `Model.init()`, which is shown below::

```javascript
[require:Mongoose validates-email]
```
