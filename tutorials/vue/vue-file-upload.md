Using Vue 2 with Axios, you can upload files easily with a few clicks.
Using the `<input>` tag and specifying the type to file, the browser will
allow you to select the file to upload from your computer. You will need
to create a form and so we recommend the form-data module to use for
your submission. An example can be seen below:

```javascript
[require:Vue vue-file-upload]
```
