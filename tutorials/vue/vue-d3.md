[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a great library for visualizing data and displaying it in your projects.
This library does not have the benefit of being able to import the cdn into your html, however,
you can install it via a package manager. This library gives you the building blocks to make
very aesthetically pleasing charts in projects.

As of this writing, development for vue-d3-charts is currently frozen as the head maintainer does not have the time
to continue improving this library. However, individuals are free to contribute [here](https://github.com/Saigesp/vue-d3-charts).
We recommend using other data visualizing libraries as any issues you may run into while using
this library will most likely not be solved for a good period of time.

If you have chosen to use this library regardless of that fact, here is how you can integrate it into your Vue.js projects.
This library is compatible with Vue 3 however these examples will be written in Vue 2. Below you will find an example
of a bar graph:

```javascript
[require:vue d3-bargraph]
```
