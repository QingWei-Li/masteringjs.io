`axios.all()` is axios's own way of making concurrent http requests and getting back an array of the responses. We recommend assigning the return value of axios.get to a variable before passing it into axios.all() to make your code more readable. Making a request would look something like as follows:

```javascript
[require:axios axios-all]
```
