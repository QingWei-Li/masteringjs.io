JavaScript, by default, does not support named parameters.
However, you can do something similar using object literals and destructuring.
You can avoid errors when calling the function without any arguments by
assigning the object to the empty object, `{}`, even if you have default
values set up.

```javascript
[require:Fundamentals named-parameters]
```
